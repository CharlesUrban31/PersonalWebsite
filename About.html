                <h2>Hello, I Am Charles Urban</h2>
                <p>I am a Computer Engineer with experience in many fields in the industry.
                    I have experience doing Indie Game Development through Unity. Those games can be found on the projects page.
                    I also have experience working for John Deere on their Embedded Operating Systems team as well as their Sensors team.
                    On those teams I mainly did small feature implementation and testing but also was asked to review documentation and traceability of requirements and test case documents.
                    While doing those tasks, I had the chance to write some simple python automation scripts to make the process easier for all future users. <br>
                    For more details regarding my previous work, feel free to email me!
